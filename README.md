# CS230-GamingRoom
Work done for client: The Gaming Room
# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room. They wanted to expand their already existing web game, to other platforms.
# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I kept the documentation clean and somewhat concise for easy and clear understanding of the work being done.
# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Having a goal, or an already existing idea of what I wanted to accomplish while coding made the process significantly easier to visualize and then implement.
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would redo the document with more information from the actual learning modules, rather than my own acquired information.
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs are the most fundatmental thing to any piece of code. Keeping the user's needs in mind takes form in features that improve accessability, friendly UI, and even allowing for user feedback. The end user is always the priority.
# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Divide and conquer in a sense. I focused very heavily on breaking down the client's needs and then implementing them seperately but in a synergistic way.
